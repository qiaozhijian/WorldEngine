## Highlights

- **WorldEngine** is a post-training framework for Physical AI that systematically addresses the long-tail safety-critical data scarcity problem in autonomous driving.
- **Data-driven long-tail discovery**: Failure-prone scenarios are automatically identified from real-world driving logs by the pre-trained agent itself — no manual design, no synthetic perturbations.
- **Photorealistic interactive simulation** via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS): Each discovered scenario is reconstructed into a fully controllable, real-time-renderable simulation environment with independent dynamic agent manipulation.
- **Behavior-driven scenario generation**: Leverages Behavior World Model (BWM) to generalize and synthesize diverse traffic variations from existing long-tail scenarios, expanding sparse safety-critical events into a dense, learnable distribution.
- **RL-based post-training** on synthesized safety-critical rollouts substantially outperforms scaling pre-training data alone — competitive with a ~10× increase in pre-training data.
- **Production-scale validation**: Deployed on a mass-produced ADAS platform trained on 80,000+ hours of real-world driving logs, reducing simulated collision rate by up to **45.5%** and achieving zero disengagements in a 200 km on-road test.


## News
- **[2026/04/09]** Official dataset released. See [OpenDriveLab/WorldEngine](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDriveLab/WorldEngine) or [OpenDriveLab/WorldEngine (ModelScope)](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/OpenDriveLab/WorldEngine)
- **[2026/04/10]** Official code repository established.


## Benchmark

We compare different post-training paradigms on the nuPlan dataset, evaluating on both open-loop and closed-loop metrics across common and rare driving scenarios.

> **Metric notes:**
> **Early stage**. Stable ckpts and corresponding results coming soon.
> - **Open-loop PDMS** is aligned with [NAVSIM v1.1](https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim) PDM Score. *Common* denotes the standard `navtest` split; *Rare* denotes the `navtest_failures` subset — failure-prone rare-case scenarios extracted from `navtest`.
> - **Closed-loop Success Rate** is defined as the fraction of simulated driving episodes completed without collision or off-road failure.
> - **Closed-loop PDMS*** is the PDM Score obtained via **SimEngine closed-loop testing**, where the planner interacts with reactive agents in simulation under real-time rendering.
>
> **Training notes:**
> - **Rare logs** are failure-prone scenarios automatically extracted from `navtrain` by the pre-trained agent itself (see [Rare Case Extraction](docs/algengine_usage.md#rare-case-extraction)). 
> - **Common logs** are the standard cases in `navtrain`.

| Method | Open-loop PDMS ↑ (common) | Open-loop PDMS ↑ (rare) | Closed-loop Success Rate ↑ | Closed-loop PDMS* ↑ |
|:-------|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Base model | 85.62 | 47.15 | 73.61 | 60.28 |
| Supervised fine-tuning on rare logs | 87.03 | 49.68 | 73.26 | 62.26 |
| Post-training on common logs | 86.15 | 51.49 | 64.58 | 56.66 |
| Post-training on rare logs | 89.29 | 62.56 | 74.31 | 62.55 |
| Post-training on rare synthetic replays | 88.01 | 56.62 | 76.39 | 62.11 |
| Post-training on rare rollouts w/o Behaviour WM | 88.99 | 59.69 | 85.07 | 68.29 |
| **Post-training with WorldEngine** | **88.95** | **59.83** | **88.89** | **70.12** |

**Key findings:**
- Post-training on **rare logs** significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (62.56 vs 49.68 open-loop rare PDMS), demonstrating the advantage of reward-guided optimization over imitation.
- Post-training on **common logs** provides limited benefit and even degrades closed-loop performance (success rate drops from 73.61% to 64.58%), confirming that long-tail event discovery is essential.
- The full **WorldEngine** pipeline achieves the best closed-loop performance (**88.89%** success rate, **70.12** PDMS*), a **+15.28%** absolute improvement in success rate over the base model.

## System Architecture

WorldEngine consists of two tightly coupled subsystems:


| Module | Function | Core Technology |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **[SimEngine](docs/WE_simulation.md)** | Closed-loop simulation with ego & agents | Hydra, Ray, rendering |
| **[AlgEngine](docs/AlgEngine.md)** | End-to-end model training & evaluation | MMDetection3D, UniAD/VADv2/HydraMDP |


## Roadmap

- [x] Core platform integration (SimEngine + AlgEngine)
- [x] Multi-GPU distributed simulation and training
- [x] Rare case extraction and fine-tuning pipeline
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and usage guides
- [x] Hugging Face / ModelScope dataset
- [x] Open-source release (code, data, early pre-trained models)
- [ ] arXiv preprint
- [ ] Behavior World Model integration
- [ ] Stable pre-trained models


## Getting Started

### Documentation Overview

WorldEngine provides comprehensive guides for each stage of your workflow:

| Guide | Purpose | Key Topics |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **[Installation](docs/installation.md)** | Set up both conda environments | Two-environment setup (simengine + algengine), dependencies, troubleshooting |
| **[Data Organization](docs/data_organization.md)** | Prepare datasets and checkpoints | Data structure, Hugging Face/ModelScope downloads, symlinks |
| **[Quick Start](docs/quick_start.md)** | Run your first experiment in 5 min | Quick test tutorial, understanding results, complete pipeline |
| **[SimEngine Usage](docs/simengine_usage.md)** | Master closed-loop simulation | Rollout scripts, distributed testing, configuration, metrics |
| **[AlgEngine Usage](docs/algengine_usage.md)** | Train and fine-tune models | Training from scratch, evaluation, rare case extraction, RL fine-tuning |

### Installation

WorldEngine requires **two separate conda environments** due to different Python requirements.

**Full installation guide:** [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)

### Quick Test

Verify your installation with a pre-trained model:

```bash
# Set up environment variable
export WORLDENGINE_ROOT=$(pwd)

# Option 1: Single GPU test 
bash scripts/closed_loop_test.sh

# Option 2: Multi-GPU test (Default 8 GPUs)
bash scripts/multigpu_closed_loop_test.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Loads a pre-trained VADv2 model (50% training data, epoch 8)
- Runs closed-loop simulation on 288 rare-case test scenarios
- Evaluates with navsim v1 PDMS (collision avoidance, progress, comfort, etc.)
- Saves results to `experiments/closed_loop_exps/e2e_vadv2_50pct/navtest_failures_NR/`

**Detailed quick start tutorial:** [docs/quick_start.md](docs/quick_start.md)
